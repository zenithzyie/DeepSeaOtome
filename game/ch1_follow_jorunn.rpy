    "far now"

    "The thief seems to know his way around. Maybe he can get me out of this mess. "

"It’s now or never!"

"3….2….1!!"

y "BLUBBB!!!!"

"With all the might I can muster I push my way through the current, leaving a trail of bubbles behind me."

"I can’t stop, crashing into the scrappy boy's shoulder."

j "Hmm?"

y "Blub!!"

"Immediately, an expertly deft hand snatches me up."

j "Oh, well this is new! Never had a fish come swimming up to my net before."

y "Blub blub blub!!"

"Wait, hang on now! Please don’t eat me!"

"Shoot! If only I could speak real words!"

"I begin to wriggle around in an attempt to catch his attention."

j "Huh? Wait, what’s this?"

"His other hand comes close and plucks something from my fins."

y "Blub!"

"Ouch!"

"The thief holds whatever he plucked from me close to his face, inspecting it with a rather curious expression."

j "..!"

"It takes me a moment to recognize it myself."

"It looks like a shard of the glowing stones back from the siren’s cave. It must have gotten caught in my fins during my escape. I hadn’t even noticed."

"The shard he is holding suddenly crumbles to pieces and a glimmer of freed magic is whisked away by the ocean current."

j "Weird. This thing stinks of magic."

"Then, much more gently than when he had first snatched me up, he brings me closer to his face."

j "Now that I’m looking, so do you, little fishie!"

y "Blub!!"

j "Aw. You’re no normal fish are you?"

#(insert mermaid swear here)

#(Screenshake effects?)

"A rumble echoes through the water as the currents become stronger."

"It looks like the seastorm is picking up even further!"

j "First things first, we better get out of here."

"He places me on his shoulder, right under all his hair. It feels surprisingly well covered."

j "Hang tight, okay? Once we get home, the forest will cover us from the worst of the storm."

y "Blub..!"

"The relief I feel is so strong that I feel my fins go weak. Thank goodness. Looks like I made the right choice after all."

"The thief swims forward at a steady pace, seemingly unbothered by the growing seastorm."

"I begin to zone out from exhaustion when he speaks again."

j "I'm Jorunn by the way! Sorry, guess I should have said that earlier."

"Jorunn..!"

j "But you can call me Jor. That's what my family calls me too."

j "Hey, you don't happen to have a name yourself, do you?"

y "Blub!"

"This guy…is incredibly chatty for a thief!"

"But he seems pretty friendly."
"That, or he just likes to talk to anybody that can't deny him the chance…"

j "Right. Can't talk and all that."

"Well, he seemed to notice this conversation was very one-sided. He sounds almost a bit disappointed that I couldn't reply."

j  "Don't worry. Miss Prash will know what to do with you. She’s sort of like the pro when it comes to all this magic stuff. And you look like magic stuff."

"Miss Prash..?"

"Is it possible? Is there another mermaid out there that can turn me human again?"

"I …… hdoioih come back"

j "Or uh, unless I’m losing it and you’re just a normal fish. I hope I’m not just talking to myself right now."

y "Blub!!!"

"Despite this, he keeps swimming, content to keep me in his hair for the time."

"The storm rumbles on, and he quiets down to focus on the journey."

"Left alone with my thoughts, my mind races every which way."

"Am I the first human to experience the sea like this?"

"I wish I had my camera. {w}But it wouldn't survive the plunge..."

"All those memories made with it must be gone now, lost to me just like my own body."

"I hope it somehow escaped my fate…"

"As he swims further along, the sound of the raging sea storm softens."

"It grows noticeably quieter, and my curiosity is piqued enough to look out of his hair."

y "..!"

"The foliage is thick here, towering over the both of us like massive trees."

"It seems like the storm is muffled by the cover of the kelp forest."

"Wow…"

j "It’s pretty way out here, don’t you think?"

"I nod, even though he can’t see it. I never knew the ocean could be so beautiful."

"The deeper we go, the darker it becomes."

"When I was younger, grandfather would tell me stories of his hunting trips out at sea. Of how dangerous it could be when all  light left the world. "

"Sometimes the storms would roll in at night, stealing away the moon and turning the world pitch black."

"I think this is what Grandpa must have meant."

"I can’t see anything in front of me at all."

"The only signs that I’m alive are my own thoughts, and the feel of  Jor’s steady swimming as he takes us deeper still."

"How could anyone even live in a place like this?"

"some transition here"

"According to Jorunn’s description, Miss Prashadi is a beautiful person."

"I’m not sure what to expect."

"I think back to the mermaids in the black market. Maybe she will be similar to them?"

Pr "Ah, you’re finally back, Jor! Did you find anything good today?"

"The voice speaks, and it sounds heart-wrenchingly familiar."

"A figure swims into view from the darker recesses of the cave."

"Grandfather!?"

j "I found something really interesting! Take a look, Miss Prash!"

"Jorunn pushes me towards Prashadi, and I just stare."

"That’s Grandfather. That’s him."

j "She had some kind of magic shards stuck in her fins."

"I tried to take them out, but they crumbled really easily…"

Pr "Well now, that is interesting!"
"Grandfather is a mermaid. This is…"

"I don’t even know what to think."

"He hunted mermaids even as he himself was one?"

"How was this even possible?"

Pr "It seems like she’s been cursed as well."

j "Who would curse a cute little fish like this?"

Pr "Not fish. This one used to be human!"

"Miss Prash, are you saying…?"

"No, wait. Jorunn is still calling him ‘Miss Prash’."

"What in the world?"

Pr "Your little friend here used to have legs. And a voice. Possibly, even hair."

Pr "A real human, she was."

"Jorunn looks at me with sparkling eyes."

"Are you able to turn her back?"

Pr "Let me get a closer look at her."

"Prashadi swims closer to me, and I can see more of this figure with Grandfather’s face."

"transition here"

"The water starts to feel heavy, like it’s clinging to my fins as Prashadi begins chanting his spell."

"A strange sparkly mist suddenly begins to envelop me."

"Prashadi continues to chant in a weird language, his hypnotic voice drowning out my thoughts."

"My fins start to itch and tingle. I begin writhing in the thickening water with discomfort, bubbles spurting all around me."

"Before I can decide if it’s even safe, the mist gently carries me up."

"I’m being pulled towards the surface of the water."

"Wait… I can’t breathe out of water like this!"

"The tingling in my fins grows stronger as the mist gets thicker. I can’t see anything."

"My whole fish body feels like it’s being warped and all I can do is squeeze my eyes shut and hope I’m not about to drown."

"Grandpa…. Hunter…"

"Will they spend the rest of their years never knowing what happened to me after the storm?"

"My face suddenly breaks the surface of the water, startling me from my thoughts, and I take a big gulp of air."

"I begin to instinctively tread water. My legs feel like they are tied together, but they are still managing to keep me afloat."

"I slowly become aware that Prashadi has stopped chanting and all I can hear is the water lapping around my body."

Pr "Ah… From the depths, your true form emerges! Well, only partially."

"What is he talking about?"

"I open my eyes and look down at myself."

"The mist has disappeared around me and I can clearly see the effects of Prashadi’s spell."
