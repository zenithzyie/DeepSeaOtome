    "It takes me a moment to recognize it myself."
    "It looks like a shard of the glowing stones back from the siren's cave. It must have gotten caught in my fins during my escape. I hadn't even noticed."

    "A rumble echoes through the water as the currents become stronger."
    "It looks like the seastorm is picking up even more!"
    j "First thing's first, we'd better get out of here."
    "He places me on his shoulder, right under all his hair. It's surprisingly well covered."
    "The currents seem weaker from here, I feel as if I can stay here without ever coming to harm."
    j "Hang tight, okay? Once we get home, the forest will cover us from the worst of the storm."

    "He's not going to eat me!"

            "My curiosity wins over, and I swim forward a little to try to peer through the hair into the sea around us."
            "As if realizing my intentions, he seems to shift, angling me in a way that gives me a better view as he swims.."
            "The foliage is thick here, tall plants towering over the both of us like massive trees."
            "With the storm muffled by the cover of the kelp forest, the world around me feels different. The swim even feels peaceful."

            j "If we go a bit further out, you'll see my home. But that's not as important right now. We gotta get you fixed up!"

        "Lean back.":
            "My exhaustion wins over and I lean back against the crook of his neck, desperate for a minute of rest."
            "If it bothers the merman he doesn't say anything about it."
            "It's oddly comforting."
            "It feels quite nice to rest against his soft hair."

    j "Right. Can't talk and all that."

    j "And you look like magic stuff."
    "Miss Prash..?"
    "Is it possible? Is there another mermaid out there that can turn me human again?"
    j "Or, uh, unless I'm losing it, and you're just a normal fish."

    y "Blub!!!"
    "Even so, he keeps swimming, content to keep me in his hair for the time being."
    "The storm rumbles on, and he quiets down to focus on the journey."
    "Left alone with my thoughts, my mind races every which way."
    "Am I the first human to experience the sea like this?"
    "I wish I had my camera. {w}But it wouldn't survive the plunge..."
    "All those memories made with it must be gone now, lost to me just like my own body."
    "I hope it somehow escaped my fate..."

#SCENE CHANGE? - Kelp Forest

    "The chatty merman swims onward, and I watch as the kelp forest grows thicker and eventually large rocky formations begin to jut out of the ground."
    show jorunn glee
    j "Almost there, little fishie! I hope you've been enjoying the ride so far."
    show jorunn neutral
    "With that, he takes us both into one of the holes in the rocks, leading to a cave."
#SCENE CHANGE - fade to black... or maybe it goes suddenly black?

    "The deeper we go, the darker it gets."
    "When I was younger, grandfather would tell me stories of his hunting trips out at sea. Of how dangerous it could be when all light left the world. "
    "Sometimes the storms would roll in at night, stealing away the moon and turning the world pitch black."
    "I think this is what he must have meant."
    "I can't see anything in front of me at all."
    "The only signs that I'm alive are my own thoughts, and the feel of  Jor's steady swimming as he takes us deeper still."
    "What kind of merperson even lives in a place like this?"
    "As the darkness stretches on, I begin to feel anxious."

    menu:
        "I'm sure it will be alright.":
            "No... I came this far already. I can't lose hope here."
            "At the end of his stories, Grandpa always came back home safe."
            "I have to trust that I can do the same."

        "I'm regretting trusting him.":
            "Maybe I made the wrong decision following him..."
            "What was I thinking, trusting a merman? His kind is the reason why I fell off Hunter's boat in the first place."
            "Anything could be in here, and I'm just letting him lead me into my doom."
            "Just when I think we're going to be wandering around in this dark void forever, something glimmers in the distance."

#SCENE CHANGE - Prashadi's Cave

    "Sure enough, what looks to be the night sky is shining above us, illuminating the entire cavern in a gentle glow."
    "How is this even possible? The sky? Does that mean there's air above us too?"
    "But we definitely swam deeper down to get here."
    j "Hello? Miss Prash?"

    j "Prashadi!! I'm back!" with vpunch
    "According to Jorunn's description, this Prashadi is a beautiful person."
    "I'm not sure what to expect."
    "I think back to the mermaids in the black market with their long hair and shiny scales."
    "Maybe she will be similar to them?"
    u "Ah, you've made it back, Jor! Did you find anything good today?"
    "The voice speaks, and it sounds heart-wrenchingly familiar."
    "A figure swims into view from the darker recesses of the cave."

    #(a flash of grandpa's sprite here)

    "Grandfather!?"
    j "I found something really interesting! Take a look, Miss Prash!"
    "Jorunn pushes me towards 'Miss Prash', and I can only stare, dumbfounded."
    "That's Grandfather. That's him."
    "But Jorunn is still calling him â€˜Miss Prash.'"
    "What in the world?"
    j "She had some kind of magic shards stuck in her fins."
    j "I tried to take them out, but they crumbled really easily..."
    gpa "Well now, that is interesting!"

    menu:
        "Grandfather is a mermaid. This is..."
        "Ridiculous. That can't be possible.":
            "But... it's undeniable that whoever I'm seeing now has Grandfather's face."
            "I don't even know what to think."

        "Have I been lied to this whole time?":
            "He hunted mermaids even as he himself was one?"
            "How is this even possible?"

    "Regardless, it seems he is known as Prashadi here."
    "Grandfather..."
    Pr "It seems like she's been cursed as well."
    j "Who would curse a cute little fish like this?"
    Pr "Not fish. This one used to be human!"
    j "Miss Prash, are you saying...?"
    Pr "Your little friend here used to have legs. And a voice. Possibly, even hair."
    Pr "A real human, she was."
    "Yes, that's right! It's [y], your granddaughter!"
    "Jorunn looks at me with sparkling eyes."
    j "Are you able to turn her back?"
    Pr "Let me get a closer look."
    "Prashadi swims closer to me, and I can see more of this figure with Grandfather's face."
    "I stare at him, hoping to somehow get him to recognize me, but he ignores me in favor of making strange hand movements."
    "The water starts to feel heavy, like it's clinging to my fins as Prashadi begins."
    "His hands wave like they're weaving something together from the water around us."
    "It's an entirely foreign movement to me."
    "This merman cannot possibly be Grandfather."
    "A strange, sparkling mist begins to envelop me."
    "My fins start to itch and tingle. I begin writhing in the thickening water with discomfort, bubbles spurting all around."
    "Before I can decide if the mist is safe, it gently carries me upward."
    "I'm being pulled towards the surface of the water."
    "Wait... I can't breathe out of water like this!"
    "The tingling in my fins grows stronger as the mist gets thicker. I can't see anything."
    "My whole fish body feels like it's being pulled apart then put back together in the same instant."
    "All I can do is squeeze my eyes shut and hope I'm not about to drown."

    #BLACK SCENE

    "Grandpa... Hunter..."
    "Will they spend the rest of their years never knowing what happened to me after the storm?"
    "My face suddenly breaks the surface of the water, startling me from my thoughts, and I take a big gulp of air."
    "I begin to instinctively tread water. My legs feel like they are tied together, but they are still managing to keep me afloat."
    "All I can hear is the water lapping around my body."
    Pr "Ah... From the depths, your true form emerges! Well, only partially."
    "I open my eyes."

    #PRASH CAVE

    "The mist has dissipated, and all that is left is me and the effects of Prashadi's spell."
